# 👋 Hi, I’m Dustin

I’m a **software engineer / builder / tech enthusiast** who’s been messing with computers for as long as I can remember.

### 🚀 How it started
- I started with tech at **age 7**, running **Windows 95**
- At **age 10**, I built my **first HTML webpage** (in Notepad!) while **GeoCities** was still a thing and Google didn't exist yet.
- Gaming pulled me deeper into development as I wanted my **own website** for my **online clan** and got some help from my first online friends at that time (when there was no Google, YouTube or ChatGPT!)
- I was playing **Quake 2 online** as a kid and suddenly coding, graphics, 3D modelling and servers became just as exciting as fragging 😄

A bit later I found a virtual community called Cybertown where I helped building 3D assets and provide coding help. With these new skills I managed to find my first developer job at a local company called Alembo way back in 2004/2005 'ish

And more later.. I helped businesses on a larger scale, developing software to automate important processes and help them get things done which eventually (and unexpectedly) caused me to travel a lot in my country and explore beautiful places

So that mix of **curiosity and creativity** never really left... 👀 I don't think it ever will...

### 🧠 What I’m into now
I love building things where **software meets the real world**:

- 🌐 Web development (PHP, JavaScript, modern stacks)
- 🔌 IoT & hardware (Raspberry Pi, sensors, smart systems)
- ⚙️ Backend logic, APIs, dashboards & tooling

If it can be automated, optimized or connected, I’m interested!

### ⚡ Fun fact
So, everything tech I do today AI, IoT, automation, software design traces back to:

Just a stay at home kid on Windows 95, wanting to learn to type fast,
learning HTML,
building a GeoCities page,
for a Quake 2 clan 😄
