  <h3 align="center">It started when I was 7...</h3>
</p>

My dad brought home a Windows 95 PC and let me draw with the mouse in Paint, which was not easy at first but fun.

- At **age 10**, I coded my **first HTML webpage** (in Notepad!) while GeoCities was still a thing and Google didn't exist yet. Yes, the browsers we used in the 90s were Internet Explorer and Netscape. Not sure if you heard about Netscape..
- Gaming pulled me deeper into development as I wanted my own website for my online clan and got some help from my first online friends at that time (when there was no Google, YouTube or ChatGPT!)
- My mom and uncle inspired me into me really wanting to be able to type fast at that time
- I was playing Quake 2 online as a kid and suddenly coding, graphics, 3D modelling and servers became just as exciting as fragging 😄

A bit later I found this virtual community called Cybertown where I helped building 3D assets and provide coding help. With these new skills I managed to find my first developer job at a local company called Alembo way back in 2004/2005 'ish. Where I discovered my first programming language, PHP and got paid to develop or fix websites, which felt weird because it still felt as if I was just playing video games.

After about four years of working there and putting in long hours, I realized I lacked soft skills, such as project management and presentation skills. So I decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree in management and law, which I completed in 2014.

And a bit later, not long after my graduation, I decided to go on a small trip, which led me to helping small tourism companies. I then went on to help businesses on a larger scale, developing software to automate important processes and make their work more efficient. This eventually (and unexpectedly) led me to travel much more within my country and explore beautiful places. Who would’ve thought an IT career would lead to regularly being in the rainforest?

</p>

So in 2023, after lots and lots of travel, I started thinking: I’m a self-taught developer and all these years I never followed any formal training in Software Engineering or ICT… but what if I did it now? Another bachelor’s this time in ICT. The more I thought about it, the more it inspired me. So I finally decided to start this new journey and in my first year I won first place with my team at a prototyping fair, where we had to build an Internet of Things project.

    So that mix of <strong>passion for tech, curiosity and creativity</strong> never really left... 👀<br />and I don't think it ever will...

### 🧠 What I’m into now
As I'm on this new journey, I love building things where **software meets the real world**:

- 🌐 Creating software solutions (PHP, JavaScript, Python)
- 🧩 Learning more about modern stacks
- 🔌 IoT & hardware (Raspberry Pi, sensors, smart systems)
- ⚙️ Backend logic, APIs, dashboards

If it can be automated, optimized or connected, I’m interested!

### ⚡ Fun fact
So, everything tech I do today AI, IoT, automation, software design traces back to:

Just a stay at home kid on Windows 95, wanting to learn to type fast,
learning HTML,
building a website
for a Quake 2 clan 😄
